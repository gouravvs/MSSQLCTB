# Team Upskilling Journey — From SQL Server DBA to Cloud & Data Engineer
Welcome to our team's **Upskilling Repository**!  
This Repo documents our collective learning journey as we transition from **SQL Server DBA roles** into **Cloud Engineering** and **Data Engineering** domains — with hands-on labs, notes, automation scripts, and other artifacts.

##  Objective
To gain real-world, hands-on experience with:
- **Cloud Platforms** (starting with Google Cloud Platform, Azure )
- **Database Migration & Management** (On-prem MSSQL to cloud SQL, Vice-versa, PostgresSQL )
- **SQL Scripting** (Creating SQL scripts for workflows in SQL ,writing stored procs )
- **Automation & DevOps** (Git, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code)
- **Data Engineering Foundations** (Python,ETL, BigQuery, Dataflow)

## Learning Approach

We follow a **practice-first, document-later** approach:
1. Every concept must be tested hands-on in GCP.
2. Each member should document what they did (with commands, screenshots, or SQL queries).
3. Weekly sync-up calls for sharing progress and reviewing learnings.

## Team Collaboration Workflow
- Pull this Git repo to your local machine and start working , learning and practicing .
- Every team member works on thier **separate branch** for their practice module or lab.  
- Once you are ready with you codes /documentation and scripts you can submit **Pull Requests (PRs)** for review and then that can be merged .
- This would ensure best practises .

# Note:  The Goals and objectives are to be ready with CLoud , Python and SQL realeated skills and using git and githib for documentaion purpose as it would help learn and get familiarize with these environments as these are basic skills required everywhere in IT where we work as a team .
